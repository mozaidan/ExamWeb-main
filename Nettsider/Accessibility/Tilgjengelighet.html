            When we started building this project, the first thing we did was
            to read the material linked in the assignment. We read all about
            SEO and user accessibility and implemented it to the best of our
            ability, all while embarking on making our first website and
            working as a team together for the first time. We tried to
            implement good SEO, and researched keywords for the website like
            “restaurant” “Italian” “menu” and the area it should be visible
            in. Then we read about how to upload a sitemap of our webpage to
            google to get crawled, and tried to build our frontpage good
            enough to get indexed by google. After that we carefully linked
            all the pages of our webpage, to ensure that all the pages were
            internally linked and no page ended up orphaned. The website setup
            started out as a mess, since none of us had any knowledge of how
            to make a clean and organized page, and at the same time work with
            CSS to make it look and feel seamless.

            Accessibility was our main focus making this page. Since there is
            a lot to learn and do to ensure accessibility for all, the job
            would be too big for us to implement all at once, so we decided to
            focus on people using screen readers, and people using keyboard
            navigation. To ensure accessibility for these groups, we
            downloaded the chrome extension “Screen reader by google chrome”
            which helped us understand how people using screen readers
            experience and interact with the internet. We used the
            text-to-speech function to learn how our website could be further
            improved, along with playing around with the keyboard navigation. Through this process, we visited a lot of
            different websites to
            try to experience the difficulties people with screen readers and
            keyboard users come across to access universal information. Some
            pages were easy to navigate, while some, even important government
            websites, were almost impossible to navigate to get the
            information you were after.

            After using the knowledge we gathered
            to try to make our website as easy to navigate as possible. We
            were deeply affected by the challenges accessibility pose,
            especially for the elderly population. One of us has a visually
            impaired grandparent that is dependent on this service every day,
            which we had in mind throughout our project. This challenge really
            motivated and inspired us to work with and ensure accessibility in
            our future projects both at university and when we eventually
            enter the workforce. After we were done with the HTML and CSS we used an online
            accessibility checker to validate our website. According to the
            accessibility check we had five errors that needed correction. We
            found out that we had a floating &lt;/div&gt; that did nothing. We
            also found that our buttons shouldn’t be placed inside the
            &lt;a&gt; element, but rather have the button as its own element
            with &lt;button onclick&gt;. This problem occurred twice in the
            code in two different HTML files. After resolving the problems the
            accessibility checker made us aware of, we put our website through
            the website accessibility checker once more to see if it found any
            other errors. It pointed out that there was another error that we
            created when we resolved the other issues with our site, after
            fixing this problem as well the validator reported no issues with
            the site. As it did not point out any further issues we concluded
            that the website had reached its full potential.
