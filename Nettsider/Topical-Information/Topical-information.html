              is becoming an increasing problem where the freedom of each
              individual is increasingly threatened. As the population is
              monitored, it will lead to choices made by some people being
              affected. A good example of this is in China, where face
              recognition is part of the everyday lives of most of the
              inhabitants. Many have benefited from this, as the streets have
              become safer and crime has decreased, but for some this can have a
              negative impact. How will this affect the political system in the
              future? At a time when the general population still has a low
              understanding of data and its impact, it will be easy for the
              government to control developments. The way face recognition can
              detect so much different information about each individual person
              can scare people into making choices they otherwise would not have
              made.

              During a possible change of power where the citizens are to vote
              for the next governing power, monitoring can influence which
              choices are made, and thus influence the election results in their
              favor. That type of data collection can be very problematic in the
              wrong hands. How could the war have been affected if there was so
              much collection of personal data in 1933 when
              <a href="https://snl.no/Adolf_Hitler" target="-blank">Hitler</a>
              came to power? Mass surveillance opens up significant "power
              differences", and it will affect or hinder the individual's

              How must this information be stored, and who should have access to
              it are key questions one must ask oneself - and how should one be
              able to reserve oneself against such monitoring. The population is
              probably not yet ready to take a stand on these issues. So a
              political elite will probably for a long time to come pursue a
              power that is difficult to imagine.

              All innovations will have positive and negative

              As an inventor, one should have discussed some assumed outcomes
              and conclude that it will most likely be more beneficial to
              innovate the product or service. The impact can in many cases be
              very difficult to predict, when a new technology has entered the
              market, specific and good service conditions are crucial for the
              safety of consumers. As it is a new product, a good introduction
              to how the product will be used will be of great help when it
              comes to the extent of damage and abuse. When one considers that
              the person who innovated the train is also responsible for all
              train accidents, there are also many other examples of such cases
              where innovation has brought accidents. When the train was
              invented, it built on already existing innovations such as the
              wheel.According to the statement "the person who invented the
              train, invented train accidents" one can then also say that Iraq,
              which invented the wheel, is thus complicit in all accidents that
              have involved the invention of the wheel.

              Innovating a product that can neither be misused nor be the cause
              of an accident is technically impossible. The world would not be
              able to move on if everyone who innovated a product were to be
              punished for all the accidents associated with that product. It is
              the intention behind the innovation that is important. At the same
              time, if one were to be punished for innovating a product involved
              in an accident later, it would have major consequences for how
              many people would actually try to innovate new products, and thus
              technological development would be reduced. Many people today
              believe that we are driven by technology, and that nothing can
              stop technological development. We call this technology
              determinism. If a single person does not choose to innovate a
              product, the chances are high that another person will take the
              job at a later date.
